# Nicolo Miranda Paper Portfolio (Recreation)

A creative recreation of Nicolo Miranda's Paper Portfolio, featuring smooth scrolling, interactive animations, and a unique layout design.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Powered by Locomotive Scroll for a seamless user experience.
- **Interactive Animations**: Created with GSAP for dynamic and engaging transitions.
- **Sticky Navigation Bar**: Implemented using ScrollTrigger for an intuitive navigation experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring adaptability across different devices (currently optimized for only larger screens).
- **Creative Loader Animation**: A custom loader animation inspired by the original portfolio.
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the elements.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: To add interactivity and logic.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For creating advanced animations.
- **Locomotive Scroll**: To achieve smooth scrolling effects.
- **ScrollTrigger**: For scroll-based animations and sticky elements.
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, GitHub for version control.

## Challenges Faced

- **Website Loader Animation**:  
  Recreating the exact loader animation was a significant challenge. Although itâ€™s not identical to the original, I implemented a custom version with my current skillset. I plan to improve this further as I grow.

- **Unique Layout**:  
  The unconventional and creative layout design required a deep understanding of positioning and responsiveness. This pushed me to refine my CSS skills and carefully align every element.

## What I Learned

- A better understanding of scroll-based animations and smooth scrolling libraries.
- How to handle compatibility between different animation frameworks.
- Improved my skills in creating custom loader animations and layouts.

## Future Improvements

- Make the loader animation closer to the original design.
- Enhance responsiveness for smaller devices.
- Add more creative animations for improved interactivity.
